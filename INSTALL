Fujiyama Renderer
=================

  Platform
-----------------
Fujiyama is supported on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows platform.

  Requirement
-----------------
For the Fujiyama core library, there is nothing necessary other than gcc.
However, there are some external libraries to be installed for some tools
come with Fujiyama.

  * GNU GCC 4.2 or higher (Linux/Mac OS X)
  * Visual Studio Express 2012 (Windows)
  * Recent Mac OS X has llvm-gcc as default C/C++ compiler. But Fujiyama
    needs GNU GCC because llvm-gcc doesn't support OpenMP yet.

  * OpenEXR for fb2exr (Converter from native image format to exr) 
  * OpenGL/GLUT for fbview (FrameBuffer viewer)
    + For Linux, freeglut needs to be installed.
    + For Mac OS X, GLUT is already installed.
    + For windows, freeglut and GLEW need to be installed.
      (freeglut: http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/)
      (GLEW:     http://glew.sourceforge.net/)

  Compile
-----------------
If you are sure that you have OpenGL/GLUT and OpenEXR installed in your system,
you can run make like this,

  $ make

The core library libscene.so will be output in lib directory, and other tools
such as scene, fbview, ply2mesh, etc .. will be in bin direcotry.

  $ make check

This runs check programs. If you run into errors, let me know. That should be
bugs or something to be fixed.

  $ make sample

This renders sample scenes and launches framebuffer viewer.

  Installation
-----------------
In order to install Fujiyama library and tools, run make with/without prefix.

  $ make install
  $ make install prefix=/usr
  $ make install prefix=$HOME/local

  Download data
-----------------
In order to render scene files that come with distribution, you need to download
geometry/image data from other sites. Go to

http://fujiyama-renderer.com/downloads.html

and find websites where you can get the data. If you couldn't find the data
don't worry. Just replace the file name with your owns. Fujiyama can read
*.ply, *.obj, *.hdr, *.jpg as input data.
